new and organised ADT homework folder!

all homeworks starting from Assignment_12 will be put into a nice folder for each week. just like this one.

but... I'm too lazy to sort through all past homeworks so any homework before Assignment_12 is only organised into 2 categories.

the data_structures folder contains all .c and .exe for all homeworks before Assignment_12 that uses struct.

the more_c folder contains all .c and .exe for all homeworks before I was introduced to data structures. so basically they are all basic C intro stuff.


yay I finally organised something lol
